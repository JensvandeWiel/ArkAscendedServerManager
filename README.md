### Why
For ARK: SE there only existed a closed source with relic like codeðŸ§“. When they made the announcement that they won't make a new version/update their software for ARK: Ascended we stepped in to fill the void, our goal is to make this software easy to use and cross platform (when we get linux binaries for the servers).
### How to use
For now the only way is to use the [nightly](https://github.com/JensvandeWiel/ArkAscendedServerManager/releases/tag/nightly) release, this is because we are not yet ready to release an alpha version. You can download the installer and install! **(nightly is unstable and does not have auto updating at this time!)**
