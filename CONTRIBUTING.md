# Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the ArkAscendedServerManager codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. If you don't know what to do you can head over to the [Issues page](https://github.com/JensvandeWiel/ArkAscendedServerManager/issues) and look for a feature you can make! *tip: if you're starting out with contributing, look for an issue with the 'good first issue' tag ;)*

## Recommended Workflow
To comfortably work on the codebase, please do the following:
1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the  **main**  branch.
2. Run `wails dev` to start the dev server. ([install](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation))
3. Use `git checkout -b feature/branch_name` to create and switch to your own feature branch. *(`bug/branch_name` for bug fixes)*
4. Code some awesome things!
5. Test your code and make sure it works/doesn't break any other features.
6. Run `wails build` one last time to make sure the build process still succeeds.
7. Push your changes to your own forked repo.
8. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/JensvandeWiel/ArkAscendedServerManager/compare).
